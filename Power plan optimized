	•	Minimum processor state: 5-15% (not 100% - this keeps idle temps low!)
	•	Maximum processor state: 100%
	•	System cooling policy: Active (fans ramp up before throttling)
	•	Processor performance boost mode: Aggressive (I recommend to use this if you have a good Fan/AIO and newer gen CPU's )
	•	Processor performance increase threshold: 10% (responds faster to load)
	•	Processor performance decrease threshold: 8% (quick to scale down when idle)
PCI Express:
	•	Link State Power Management: Off (crucial for low latency with GPU)
Hard Disk:
	•	Turn off after: Never (0)
USB:
	•	USB selective suspend: Disabled (prevents input lag)
Sleep/Display:
	•	Sleep after: Never
	•	Display timeout: Your preference (doesn't affect performance)
Advanced Hidden Settings (The Real Magic)
Open Command Prompt as Administrator and run these commands. First, get your power plan GUID:

cmd
powercfg /list
Look for your custom plan and copy its GUID, then set it as active:

cmd
powercfg /setactive [YOUR_GUID]
Now apply these performance tweaks:
1. Processor Performance Settings:

cmd
:: Set processor performance boost mode to Aggressive
powercfg /setacvalueindex SCHEME_CURRENT SUB_PROCESSOR PERFBOOSTMODE 2

:: Disable processor performance core parking
powercfg /setacvalueindex SCHEME_CURRENT SUB_PROCESSOR CPMINCORES 100

:: Set heterogeneous thread scheduling policy (for hybrid CPUs)
powercfg /setacvalueindex SCHEME_CURRENT SUB_PROCESSOR HETEROPOLICY 3

:: Processor performance autonomous mode (let CPU manage itself efficiently)
powercfg /setacvalueindex SCHEME_CURRENT SUB_PROCESSOR PERFAUTONOMOUS 0

:: Energy Performance Preference (0 = maximum performance)
powercfg /setacvalueindex SCHEME_CURRENT SUB_PROCESSOR PERFEPP 0

:: Processor performance increase threshold (lower = more responsive)
powercfg /setacvalueindex SCHEME_CURRENT SUB_PROCESSOR PERFINCTHRESHOLD 10

:: Processor performance decrease threshold
powercfg /setacvalueindex SCHEME_CURRENT SUB_PROCESSOR PERFDECTHRESHOLD 8

:: Apply settings
powercfg /setactive SCHEME_CURRENT
2. Latency Tolerance Settings:

cmd
:: Disable latency tolerance for better responsiveness
powercfg /setacvalueindex SCHEME_CURRENT SUB_SLEEP AWAYMODE 0
powercfg /setacvalueindex SCHEME_CURRENT SUB_SLEEP ALLOWSTANDBY 0

:: Apply
powercfg /setactive SCHEME_CURRENT
3. GPU Power Settings:

cmd
:: Disable PCIe Link State Power Management
powercfg /setacvalueindex SCHEME_CURRENT SUB_PCIEXPRESS ASPM 0

:: Apply
powercfg /setactive SCHEME_CURRENT
